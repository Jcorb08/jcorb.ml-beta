        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <em>If you were wondering my nickname is Jcorb</em>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Joseph (Joe), 20 years old, living in West Sussex. <br>
            I'm a 3rd Year MComp Computer Science Student from the University of Sussex, currently looking for a placement. <br>
            I've been learning the Violin since Year 3 and Bass since Year 10. <br>
            I can read music fluently, primarily from playing in a Folk Club at Secondary School. <br>
            I'm a valued member of my local Volleyball club, since 2018 although I am considerably younger than most of them! <br>
            Ever since the GameBoy came out, video gaming is a hobby of mine, it helped to develop teamwork and cooporation with teammates online. <br>
            Scouts has been an intrest since 6, I'm now a leader and Distict Youth Comissioner for Adur Valley. <br>
            I enjoy Hiking as the views you get at the top of the mountain are superb. <br>
            To go inconjucntion with my video gaming hobby I build the PCs I use to game on, this involves part searching and a lot of patience. <br>
            I've made this Website from stratch because I took an intrest in server since setting up a simple Minecraft server with friends, and thought it be fun to make a Web Server.
